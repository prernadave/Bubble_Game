## How to Play

1. Open the [Bubble Hitting Game](https://hit-the-bubble.netlify.app/) in a modern web browser.
2. Bubbles will appear on the screen. Each bubble contains a number.
3. A hit value will be displayed at the top of the screen.
4. Click on the bubble with the same number as the hit value to score points.
5. Your score will increase by 10 points for each correct hit.
6. The game has a timer of 60 seconds. Try to score as many points as you can before the timer runs out.

## Gameplay Tips

- Keep an eye on the hit value at the top of the screen.
- Click on the bubbles quickly to match the hit value and score points.
- The bubbles will bounce and move slightly for an engaging experience.


## Potential Bugs and Considerations

While I've worked to create an enjoyable gaming experience, here are a couple of important considerations:

- **Game Over Logic**: Ensure that the game correctly resets and handles player interaction when the timer runs out.
- **Performance**: Extensive animations could impact performance, particularly on older devices.

I appreciate your understanding as I work to enhance the game further. Enjoy playing the Bubble Hitting Game!
